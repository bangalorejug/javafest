I am a software engineer working with Spring Boot, developer tooling, and AI-powered application development. Over the years, I have gained experience building and deploying cloud-native spring boot applications. I am passionate about developer tooling, OpenRewrite, and everything Spring.
I have previously worked on Spring IDE support for VS Code and Eclipse, improving developer productivity when working with Spring boot applications in IDEs.

In my current role, I contribute to commercial products in the Tanzu portfolio at Broadcom, write OpenRewrite migration recipes to help teams upgrade Spring Boot projects to newer versions seamlessly, and have contributed to the OpenRewrite open-source project.

Talks:
- I have presented at Spring I/O 2023 in Las Vegas on enhancing developer productivity with the Spring Tools extension for VS Code
- I also had the opportunity to speak at Java User Group AI Day in Bengaluru, introducing developers to Spring AI, its capabilities, and how it simplifies large language model integration into Spring applications
