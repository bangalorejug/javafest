Hi, I’m Sumanth, a Java enthusiast with over 10 years of experience building enterprise applications and microservices. Most of my work revolves around Java, Spring Boot, and modern development practices, helping teams write cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code.

I’m passionate about how Java has evolved from Java 8 to the latest versions and how these changes let us write less and do more. I love sharing practical tips on refactoring legacy code using modern features and making programming fun and productive again.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring AI-driven development tools, learning new tech, and helping teams adopt better coding practices.
