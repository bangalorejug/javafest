With over 20 years of industry experience spanning diverse technologies, I am a seasoned Corporate Trainer, Developer, and Architect specializing in building, scaling, and securing enterprise-grade applications. My career journey covers the full spectrum of modern software development â€” from UI/UX design and full-stack engineering to microservices architecture, micro frontends, DevSecOps, SRE practices, and multi-cloud deployments.

I have worked extensively with SQL/NoSQL databases, data science, machine learning, and cutting-edge technologies such as Generative AI and prompt engineering, enabling me to design intelligent, secure, and high-performing systems. My expertise also extends to digital transformation and digital marketing strategies, bridging the gap between technology and business impact.

As a freelance corporate trainer, I have delivered technical sessions and hands-on workshops for numerous organizations across the globe. I have been a featured speaker at major industry events, including AWS Community Day, Java User Group meetups, DevOn conferences, ZopDev events, and multiple corporate technology summits. My sessions are known for blending deep technical insights with practical real-world applications, often accompanied by live demos that connect theory with implementation.

Over the years, I have trained and mentored thousands of professionals, helping them upskill in areas like cloud-native architecture, secure software development, observability, performance optimization, and emerging technology adoption. My approach emphasizes clarity, interactivity, and actionable takeaways, ensuring attendees leave with both knowledge and confidence to apply it in production.

For Java Fest 2025, I bring my deep expertise in Enterprise Java security and my passion for empowering developers to build resilient, AI-aware applications. In an era of intelligent cyber threats, I am committed to equipping teams with modern defense strategies that ensure security, scalability, and trust in Java-powered systems.
