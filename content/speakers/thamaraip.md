I am a Solution Architect with over 20 years of experience in the Java ecosystem. My main strength is problem-solving—from diagnosing complex performance issues to designing scalable, high-performing enterprise systems. I specialize in Java performance tuning, database optimization, and enterprise architecture, helping teams build reliable and efficient applications. Recently, I have extended my focus to AI agent development in Java, applying concepts like reasoning, memory, and vector databases to enterprise use cases.

I have presented at developer meetups and spoke at Java Fest 2024 on “Powering Machine Learning in Java.”
