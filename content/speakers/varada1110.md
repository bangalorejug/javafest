My primary role as an OpenJDK Developer involve in maintenance of the AIX platform on OpenJDK. My responsibilities encompassed conducting tier tests and standalone jtreg tests on AIX, with a focus on identifying root causes for failures and devising optimized patches. These patches, submitted as pull requests, underwent thorough community review before integration into the codebase. Engaging with diverse community members beyond IBM has been integral to my growth, enabling me to expand my knowledge, skills, and collaborative abilities. This role has equipped me with a comprehensive skill set encompassing Java, AIX, C++, Git and proficiency in Linux commands. Additionally, I excel in analyzing jtreg output to effectively address failures, thereby enhancing performance and overall system capabilities
