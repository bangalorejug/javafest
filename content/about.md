JAVAFEST is an annual conference hosted with enthusiasm and dedication by the Java User Groups. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer, a budding enthusiast, or a techie, we warmly invites you to join this dynamic community and immerse yourself in the world of Java.

At JAVAFEST, we pride ourselves on being different from other conferences by adhering to our founding principles. Here's how we stands out:

1. **Community-Driven Sessions:** The content of our sessions is not determined solely by speakers or the conference committee. We value the input and preferences of our community members. We engage with Java User Groups (JUG) across India, including engineers from leading companies such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, Redhat, Salesforce, Jetbrains, and more. By actively involving the community, we ensure that the topics discussed at JAVAFEST align with the interests and needs of our attendees.
2. **Embracing Research and Academic Participation:** We recognize that technology conferences shouldn't be limited to working professionals alone. JAVAFEST aims to create a platform that fosters collaboration between professionals, students, researchers, and academics. We believe that incorporating diverse perspectives and encouraging research-based discussions can fuel innovation and push the boundaries of Java-related knowledge.

At JAVAFEST, our primary focus is on community empowerment, knowledge sharing, and networking. We strive to bridge the gap between professionals and students, promote inclusivity, and provide a platform where participants can contribute and learn from each other. By adhering to these founding principles, we differentiate ourselves from other conferences and create a unique experience for all attendees.
