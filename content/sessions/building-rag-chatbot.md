Summary of the Workshop

The "Building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot" workshop offers a comprehensive, hands-on experience in developing intelligent chatbots that combine retrieval-based and generative AI techniques. Participants will learn to harness the power of LLMs and vector databases, to create chatbots that can efficiently retrieve relevant information from large datasets and generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses. The workshop covers essential concepts such as vector stores, retrieval mechanisms, prompt engineering, and the integration of generative models. 

Outcome
By the end of the session, attendees will have built a fully functional RAG chatbot and gained the skills to deploy similar systems in real-world applications

It will be a fully hands-on session where we will start the workshop from ground zero
