We have been building monolithic applications for many years and have faced some challenges. Microservices architecture emerged as an alternative to solve the difficulties imposed by monolithic architecture, but it brings its own set of challenges. What about combining the best of both worlds? Welcome to Modular Monoliths.

Modular Monolith is an architectural style that combines the simplicity of monolithic architecture with the power and flexibility of microservices. 

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn: 

- What are the challenges with Monoliths and Microservices 
- Introduction to Modular Monoliths 
- Creating a Modular Monolith using Spring Boot and Spring Modulith 
- Identifying and defining module boundaries 
- Imposing Module Boundaries 
- Communication between Modules 
- Async communication between modules using events 
- Testing modules independently 
- Generating C4 Model documentation using Spring Modulith 
- Best practices for building Modular Monoliths
