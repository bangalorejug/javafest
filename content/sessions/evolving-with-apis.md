Java has long been the backbone of enterprise development, However, the landscape of modern software architecture is rapidly evolving and they demand real time responsiveness, flexibility and adaptive capabilities that are beyond the traditional REST architecture. This is where GraphQL is taking its shape by offering a more flexible, query-driven alternative that gives our clients a greater control over the data.  

Weâ€™ll examine the core GraphQL tools and frameworks that are emerging in the Java ecosystem and how they empower developers to build scalable, maintainable, and future-ready APIs. We will define what really matters to Java developers, software architects, and engineering teams navigating this technological transformation from rethinking how APIs are designed and consumed by choosing the right tools and patterns that align with evolving business needs in the world of GraphQL. We will also explore on how GenAI brings a more powerful dimension to GraphQL bridging user intent and backend data. 

The session also covers a live demo of how graphQL can be implemented and established over your API layer.
