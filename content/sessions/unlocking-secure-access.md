In a world increasingly driven by digital interactions, the need for secure, efficient, and user-friendly authentication methods is paramount. This session explores cutting-edge techniques for implementing passwordless logins using Passkey and WebAuthn protocols, redefining how users authenticate across devices. We will also delve into the role of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in managing secure, stateless user sessions, enhancing security and scalability for modern applications. Attendees will gain practical insights into creating frictionless yet secure user experiences while minimizing risks associated with password-based logins.
