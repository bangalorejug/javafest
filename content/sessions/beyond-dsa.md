This talk will start with Why efficient data handling matters in the modern world" and how DSA is trying to solve.  
We will discuss common problems we face while dealing with large data sets.  
We will deeply explore "BloomFilter"  and see how it works and fits the bill along the lines of Performance and Memory. 
We will also explore the practical use cases where it's being used and where it shouldn't be used and how it can help us to save backend API calls effectively.  
Talk will also cover its actual implementation in Java.  
This is a real project use case and hence no POC :)

Come and learn the true Software Engineering problem and its solution.
