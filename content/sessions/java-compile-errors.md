An interactive session on understanding Java Compiler Errors

All of us have got errors multiple times in our code. Have we ever wondered why such an error is there in the first place? This talk will discuss some of the compiler errors we have been encountering and will go a little deeper to understand them. In turn, this will help us to understand the language and the underlying design better to make us better programmers. We will also discuss evolution of some of the errors to the present state across different versions. From the Eclipse Java Compiler perspective, we will discuss how the errors also provide venues for further features. Anyone who has written a basic Java Program should be able to attend this talk.
