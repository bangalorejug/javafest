Java Developers may think that my performance issues are different than your performance issues. But that’s not the underlying truth. All the perf hits are because some common anti-pattern in the code. This workshop will reveal the real life bugs, glitches, anti-patterns which we have observed over the decades. We will also learn how to analyze these issues using industry standard tools. How these tools have advanced in last 5 years and what are the hot features of these tools. Scope is infinite but in this workshop, we will identify :-
