Learn how to fortify Java applications against AI-powered cyberattacks using modern authentication, anomaly detection, and runtime defenses — with live attack and mitigation demos.

AI is transforming development — but it’s also supercharging cyberattacks. AI-driven vulnerability scanning, automated exploit generation, and adaptive phishing mean your Java applications are facing a smarter adversary than ever before.
In this session, we’ll dive into modern, AI-aware security practices for Java developers. From securing APIs against automated reconnaissance to detecting anomalous requests with machine learning, we’ll explore cutting-edge techniques to fortify your Java applications.
You’ll learn how to implement runtime threat detection, harden authentication mechanisms against AI-powered brute force, and apply zero-trust principles in Java microservices. We’ll conclude with a live simulation of an AI-assisted attack and demonstrate real-time mitigation strategies using Spring Security, JWT best practices, and cloud-native tooling.

By the end of this talk, you’ll be equipped with battle-ready strategies to secure your Java applications in the era of intelligent threats.
