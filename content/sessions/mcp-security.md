The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is transforming how AI systems connect with external tools and data through a simple, secure standard. In this session, we’ll dive into how MCP works under the hood—examining the JSON-RPC flow, how servers, clients, and tools communicate, and what really happens behind the scenes.

We’ll then explore the MCP security specification and demonstrate how to implement it with Spring AI.

Finally, we’ll deploy MCP servers on AWS Fargate, GCP Cloud Run, and Azure Container Apps, and show how they seamlessly connect with MCP hosts like ChatGPT and Claude.

By the end of this session, you’ll be equipped to build, secure, and deploy MCP servers that connect reliably with enterprise systems and scale across your organization.
