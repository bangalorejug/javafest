Why does one piece of code scream while another crawls? In this high-energy, hands-on workshop, we‚Äôll peel back the layers of modern CPUs and show how Java code can be tuned to dance with the hardware. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned professional, a fresher, or a Java enthusiast, you‚Äôll gain practical skills to unlock performance. Together we‚Äôll explore Caches, Branches, and SIMD through live coding, real benchmarks (JMH), profiling (JFR/VisualVM), and the blazing speed of the Panama Vector API. Small code changes, massive speedups ‚Äî come ready to experiment and supercharge your Java!
