In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, Java is emerging as a powerful and versatile platform for AI. This talk will take you on the Java ecosystem for AI, focusing on key tools and frameworks that are shaping the future of AI in Java.
 
We will begin with LLM4J, a pioneering project that integrates large language models into Java, allowing developers to seamlessly incorporate advanced AI capabilities into their applications. We'll also dive into Spring AI, a framework that is gaining traction in enterprise applications for its robust AI integration capabilities. Finally, weâ€™ll explore the Deep Java Library (DJL), an open-source, engine-agnostic library designed to simplify the deployment of deep learning models in Java, with support for leading frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet.
Join us to discover how Java is becoming an essential tool in the AI landscape, empowering developers to build intelligent, scalable solutions.
