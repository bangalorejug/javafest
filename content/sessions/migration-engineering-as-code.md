In today’s world of too much more work always on the developers plate, updates, upgrades, migrations, and refactoring are often seen as tedious, secondary work. But with frameworks/tools like OpenRewrite, we can turn these tasks into rewarding, strategic parts of a developer’s role.

*OpenRewrite* is a powerful, modular framework designed to automate and modernize codebases. It enables developers to define and execute complex code transformations, making it easier than ever to refactor, migrate, and optimize code. Here’s what OpenRewrite makes possible:

- *Automate routine tasks*: Code formatting, renaming, reorganizing—all handled automatically.
- *Refactor for maintainability*: Improve code performance, scalability, and readability.
- *Migrate seamlessly*: Move code to new frameworks or technologies with confidence.
- *Enforce best practices*: Standardize your codebase for quality and consistency.
- *Monetize expertise*: Create and sell plugins to help others with their code transformations.

By treating refactoring as a first-class engineering task, OpenRewrite opens up new opportunities for innovation and even revenue. This talk will show you how Migration Engineering as Code (MEaC) can elevate your skills, improve workflows, and transform the way you approach code maintenance.

Don’t miss this chance to learn how to make refactoring a core part of your development process—and your career!
