AI in modern applications must go beyond simple prompts to deliver real value—it needs to reason over your data, respect context, and integrate with external systems. In this fast-paced 90-minute workshop, you’ll learn how to power Spring Boot applications with Spring AI.
We’ll start with chat completions using ChatClient, then ground responses with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). From there, we’ll extend the application with Tools and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—standardizing how AI models call APIs, query data, and orchestrate real-world workflows.
By the end, you’ll walk away with a working Spring AI project and a clear roadmap for building production-ready AI agents..
