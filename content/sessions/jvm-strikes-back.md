Java isn't just for the enterprise backend anymore. While Python has dominated AI's research and prototyping phase, Java's enduring strengths—proven scalability, security, and performance—are making it the ideal choice for building and deploying AI applications in production.

This talk reveals how modern JVM features like Project Loom and Panama are revolutionizing Java's capabilities for AI. We’ll explore a new breed of AI libraries and show how a Python + Java workflow lets you use the best of both worlds. Learn how to transform your enterprise applications with intelligent, secure, and scalable AI solutions on the JVM.
