PLEASE NOTE: This is Beginner Level workshop for College grads, Freshers and Junior Engineers.

Java has changed a lot in recent years, but getting started and writing good code still begins with the basics. In this session, we’ll walk through simple and practical ways to write clean, clear, and modern Java — even if you are just starting your journey.


You’ll learn:
Object-oriented concepts.
How to write Java code that is easy to understand
The difference between “it works” and “it’s well-designed”
How to gradually improve your code without big rewrites

This talk is for anyone beginning with Java — helping you build confidence and write Java that grows with you as you grow as a developer.
