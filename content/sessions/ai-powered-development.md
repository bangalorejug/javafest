AI isn’t replacing developers. It’s redefining what “competent” means.

In this talk, I share practical ways to pair-program with AI. Ship faster without hurting quality. Scope problems so models help, not hinder. Give the right context from your codebase. Ask for outputs you can test and verify.

We’ll cover where AI shines: scaffolding, tests, refactors, docs, and reviews. We’ll also cover where humans must lead: architecture, trade-offs, and security.

The future of software development will rely on AI. This session shows how to use it well, every day.
