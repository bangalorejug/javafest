In today’s fast-changing frontend world, choices are often driven by the “latest is greatest” mindset. But behind every modern framework lies a set of timeless principles that define scalability, performance, and developer productivity.
In this hands-on session, we’ll revisit the core concepts of frontend architecture from a Java developer’s perspective — understanding how modern UI technologies integrate with Java backends, what truly matters when choosing a framework, and how to build maintainable, future-ready applications without getting lost in trends.
Join us to explore the “why” behind modern frontend development — and not just the “what’s new.”
