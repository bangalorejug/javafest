Codelab illustrates the concept with the address completion and standardization use case. For this we will be building a Java Cloud Function that does the following tasks:

Takes latitude and longitude coordinates
Calls the Google Maps Geocoding API to get corresponding addresses
Uses Gemini 1.0 Pro Function Calling feature to deterministically standardize and summarize those addresses in a specific format that we need.
