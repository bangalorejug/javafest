This workshop explores the evolution of key Java features starting from Java 17 through to the upcoming Java 25 release. We will dive deep into major enhancements such as pattern matching, which simplifies complex condition checks, and virtual threads, a game-changer for lightweight, high-performance concurrency. You will also learn about sequenced collections that bring predictable iteration order to the collection framework, stream gatherers that offer advanced data processing capabilities, and the new capability to launch multi-file source-code programs directly, making Java development more streamlined. Additionally, flexible constructor bodies improve object creation flexibility and expressiveness. Through this session, you'll gain insight into how these incremental enhancements collectively improve code readability, developer productivity, and runtime performance. Live demonstrations will showcase practical use cases for these features, enabling you to immediately apply them in your software projects. Whether you're a Java enthusiast or an experienced developer, this talk will prepare you for modern Java development challenges with confidence and ease
