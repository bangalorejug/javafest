The 90-minute workshop “Write Less, Do More – The Power of Modern Java” will feature Vikas and Sumanth demonstrating the latest Java features, including scoped values, flexible constructor bodies, and compact object headers from Java 25. Participants will explore advanced concepts like pattern matching for switch and instanceof, virtual threads, records, sealed types, enhanced switch expressions, and Stream gatherers. This session highlights how these modern enhancements empower developers to write cleaner, more efficient, and performant Java code.
