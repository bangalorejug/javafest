We use a simple demo for understanding how to queue requests to a resource. Our Queues will have techniques like backpressure, graceful degradation. 
We'll understand how different queuing mechanisms work. Queues and the contending resource is implemented as a Java service, using Core/Spring Core. 
Project code will be shared during the demo, and it will be a participative demo for all participants.
